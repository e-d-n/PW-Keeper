# PW-Keeper

A number of Web-Sites today are requesting users to create an account with login information.
Web-Sites to purchase products or make payments for services require not only login info but often have Security Questions that require a response. You may also want to keep notes about the 
Web-Site like a PIN number or contact phone number or the name of a contact person.

Best Practice states you should use different passwords for each account.
The real question here is how many accounts do you have?
Can you remember 10 or more passwords and different Security Answers for 10 Web-Sites?

OK everyone gets the idea. But how do most of us manage this task? Here an in-depth answer.

With PW Keeper you have the ability to have one Master Password to access a database on your device that stores this necessary information either in Internal Storage or in External Storage provided your device has a SD Card. 
When the app is installed the storage location is assigned by the user.

PW Keeper is compatible with Nexus 5X size phones and 7 in 9 in and 10 in Tablets.

As the owner of the device you have complete control over the sensitive stored information.
We have included a three line text field that will hold about 140 characters.
The information is not transmitted over the Internet to some cloud server every time you
access the information.

The Master Password can only be changed when the user is logged in.
All stored data can be updated or deleted by the user.
The database can be backed up with a single tap and removed if your device has a 
SD Card without disturbing the database. Even if the data is stored Internally. 

PW Keeper was hand made on Earth in the United States at Arizona in the White Mountains.

PW Keeper is available for purchase at Google Play Store
